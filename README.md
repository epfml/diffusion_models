# Master Thesis on Text-to-Image Generative models
## Implementing and Experimenting with Diffusion Models for Text-to-Image Generation

*By **Robin Zbinden** under the supervision of **Luis Barba** and **Martin Jaggi***.

In this project, we **implement a text-to-image generative model** based on DALL-E 2 and conduct some experiments to understand the possibilities of this type of models.
